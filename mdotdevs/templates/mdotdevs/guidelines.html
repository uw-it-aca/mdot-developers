If it is intended for very specific audiences (such as a class, department, or school), we advise departments and schools to set up their own App Stores.  If you need assistance in doing this, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:help@uw.edu">help@uw.edu</a>.</li>

                </ul>
